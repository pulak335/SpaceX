# Getting Started with Create React App

install project:


firstly run command: npm install

then download the all dependency from node package

then run command: npm start

project will be run on 'http://localhost:3000/' port


deploy project :
We will start by creating a build of our application by running this command:

'npm run build'

So, now our build folder will get generated which will contain all the production-ready files.

Now, there are two ways to deploy our application to Netlify.

Drag & Drop
Netifly has made it so easy that we have to just drag and drop our build folder into their online app (Rightmost image above), and our application will get deployed to a live URL.
